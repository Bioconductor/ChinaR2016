# ChinaR2016: An overview of genomic data analysis in _Bioconductor_

Bioconductor presentation for the 9th China-R Conference, Renmin
University of China, May 27 - 29, 2016.

## Abstract

_Bioconductor_ is a collection of more than 1,100 individually
code-reviewed software packages, hundreds more annotation and
experiment data packages, and specialized data structures for
high-throughput genomic (especially sequence) analysis. This talk will
overview _Bioconductor_ software and principles across several
domains, especially sequence analysis. We will mention common work
flows, statistical challenges, working with large data, and placing
results in biological context. The principles apply to other areas
where _Bioconductor_ helps analysis, including microarrays
(expression, methylation, copy number, SNP), flow cytometry,
proteomics, and image analysis.
